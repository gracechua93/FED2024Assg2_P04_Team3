This is my FED Assignment 2.

## Project Overview
MokeSell is an online platform that serves as a consumer-to-consumer marketplace for buying and
selling new and second-hand items. The website takes a modern, minimalist approach and focuses on clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and clear typography, enabling users to achieve their core objectives—buying or selling items—without unnecessary distractions.  
By incorporating responsive design, MokeSell ensures a seamless experience for both mobile and desktop users, making the platform adaptable to various devices and user needs.

## Design Process
The design process of MokeSell focused on understanding the needs of both sellers and buyers to create a platform that facilitates quick and secure transactions.  
### User Stories
- As a seller, I want to easily list my items with photos and descriptions, so that I can reach potential buyers quickly.
- As a buyer, I want to filter search results based on categories, and price, so that I can find the exact item I am looking for.
- As a mobile user, I want a responsive design, so that I can use the platform on both desktop and mobile devices.
- As a Returning Buyer, I want to see my previous purchases, so that I can reorder similar items or check warranty details.
